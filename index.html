                    question: "A nurse is caring for a patient who has been experiencing severe diarrhea for 3 days. The patient's blood pressure is 88/56 mmHg, heart rate is 118 bpm, and skin turgor is poor. Laboratory results show: Hgb 18 g/dL, Hct 54%, BUN 45 mg/dL, and urine specific gravity 1.035. Which intervention should the nurse anticipate FIRST?",
                    options: [
                        "Administer 0.45% sodium chloride at 125 mL/hr",
                        "Administer lactated Ringer's solution at 200 mL/hr",

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "The patient presents with severe hypovolemia as evidenced by hypotension (BP 88/56), tachycardia, and hemoconcentration (elevated Hgb, Hct, BUN, and urine specific gravity). The FIRST priority is to restore intravascular volume with an isotonic solution. Lactated Ringer's is the most appropriate choice as it expands plasma volume rapidly and contains electrolytes lost through diarrhea."

                        "Blood pressure increases from 90/60 to 118/76 mmHg",
                        "Urine output increases to 50 mL/hour",

                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "Bilateral crackles indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs, suggesting fluid volume excess and potential pulmonary edema - a serious complication of over-resuscitation. This finding requires immediate intervention to prevent respiratory compromise."

                    options: [
                        "I'll drink plain water throughout my runs to stay hydrated",

                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "Sports drinks containing electrolytes provide both water and electrolyte replacement, addressing the proportional losses that occur with sweating (isotonic fluid loss). This matches the pathophysiology of hypovolemia where water and electrolytes are lost in equal proportions."

                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "Capillary refill time directly reflects peripheral perfusion status. Improvement from 5 seconds (severely delayed) to 2 seconds (normal) indicates restored tissue perfusion at the microcirculatory level."

                    question: "An elderly patient with hypovolemia secondary to poor oral intake is receiving IV fluid replacement. The nurse notes the patient becomes increasingly confused after receiving 1000 mL of 0.45% sodium chloride over 2 hours. What is the MOST likely explanation for this change?",
                    options: [
                        "The hypotonic solution caused cerebral edema",
                        "The patient is experiencing worsening dehydration",

                    correct: 0,
                    rationale: "Hypotonic solutions (0.45% NaCl) should only be used after the patient is hemodynamically stable because they shift fluid from intravascular to intracellular spaces. Rapid administration in hypovolemic patients can cause cerebral edema as water moves into brain cells, manifesting as confusion or altered mental status."

Initial treatment with 2 liters of D5W results in worsening confusion and a seizure. What is the MOST likely cause of this deterioration?",

                        "Continued hypovolemia requiring more fluids"
                    ],
                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "The runner likely had isotonic fluid losses (sweat contains sodium). Administering D5W (free water after dextrose metabolism) without electrolytes diluted the remaining serum sodium, causing acute hyponatremia. This leads to cerebral edema, confusion, and seizures."

                    id: 7,
                    question: "A patient with chronic kidney disease develops hypovolemia from vomiting. The nurse notes the following: BP 92/58 mmHg, K+ 5.8 mEq/L, creatinine 3.2 mg/dL. Which IV fluid would be MOST appropriate for initial resuscitation?",
                    options: [

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) is the safest choice for this patient. With hyperkalemia (K+ 5.8) and kidney disease, fluids containing potassium must be avoided. Lactated Ringer's contains 4 mEq/L of potassium."

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Visible jugular veins at 45 degrees indicate elevated venous pressure and potential fluid overload. Normal jugular venous distention should not be visible above the clavicle when the patient is at 45 degrees. This early sign of fluid excess requires slowing the infusion to prevent pulmonary edema."

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Oral rehydration solutions contain balanced electrolytes and glucose for optimal absorption, addressing both water and electrolyte components of isotonic fluid loss. Coffee, cola, and beer are diuretics that would worsen hypovolemia."

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Hemoconcentration occurs in fluid volume deficit when blood becomes more concentrated due to water loss. This results in elevated Hgb, Hct, BUN, and urine specific gravity as the kidneys conserve water."

                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "The patient exhibits classic signs of fluid volume excess (FVE) with pulmonary congestion. The lab values show hemodilution (low sodium, hemoglobin, and BUN), confirming FVE rather than true anemia or hyponatremia. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, directly addresses the excess fluid by promoting diuresis."

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Loop diuretics like furosemide cause significant potassium loss through increased urinary excretion. Hypokalemia manifests as muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias (flattened T waves, U waves, PVCs). This is a common and dangerous side effect requiring monitoring and replacement."

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "This distribution (400-400-200) best accommodates the patient's needs throughout the day. Most oral medications are given during day/evening shifts, requiring fluid. Patients are typically more active and thirsty during daytime. The smaller night allocation reduces nocturia and sleep disruption while maintaining comfort."

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Low albumin (normal 3.5-5.0 g/dL) directly causes decreased plasma oncotic pressure. Albumin maintains the osmotic gradient that keeps fluid in vessels. With cirrhosis, the liver cannot produce adequate albumin, allowing fluid to shift into interstitial spaces (edema) and peritoneal cavity (ascites)."
