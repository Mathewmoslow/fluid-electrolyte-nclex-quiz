                    question: "A nurse is caring for a patient who has been experiencing severe diarrhea for 3 days. The patient's blood pressure is 88/56 mmHg, heart rate is 118 bpm, and skin turgor is poor. Laboratory results show: Hgb 18 g/dL, Hct 54%, BUN 45 mg/dL, and urine specific gravity 1.035. Which intervention should the nurse anticipate FIRST?",
                    options: [
                        "Administer 0.45% sodium chloride at 125 mL/hr",
                        "Administer lactated Ringer's solution at 200 mL/hr",
                        "Encourage oral fluid intake of 2000 mL/day",
                        "Insert a urinary catheter to monitor output"
                    ],
                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "The patient presents with severe hypovolemia as evidenced by hypotension (BP 88/56), tachycardia, and hemoconcentration (elevated Hgb, Hct, BUN, and urine specific gravity). The FIRST priority is to restore intravascular volume with an isotonic solution. Lactated Ringer's is the most appropriate choice as it expands plasma volume rapidly and contains electrolytes lost through diarrhea."

                    id: 2,
                    question: "A patient with hypovolemia is receiving IV fluid resuscitation. Which assessment finding would indicate to the nurse that the fluid therapy is becoming excessive?",
                    options: [
                        "Blood pressure increases from 90/60 to 118/76 mmHg",
                        "Urine output increases to 50 mL/hour",
                        "Development of bilateral crackles in lung bases",
                        "Heart rate decreases from 110 to 88 bpm"
                    ],
                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "Bilateral crackles indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs, suggesting fluid volume excess and potential pulmonary edema - a serious complication of over-resuscitation. This finding requires immediate intervention to prevent respiratory compromise."

                    question: "A nurse is teaching a patient who experiences frequent episodes of mild hypovolemia due to excessive sweating during marathon training. Which fluid replacement strategy demonstrates the patient's understanding of appropriate self-management?",
                    options: [
                        "I'll drink plain water throughout my runs to stay hydrated",
                        "I'll take salt tablets before each training session",
                        "I'll drink sports drinks containing electrolytes during long runs",
                        "I'll limit fluid intake to prevent cramping while running"
                    ],
                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "Sports drinks containing electrolytes provide both water and electrolyte replacement, addressing the proportional losses that occur with sweating (isotonic fluid loss). This matches the pathophysiology of hypovolemia where water and electrolytes are lost in equal proportions."

                    id: 4,

                    options: [
                        "Temperature decreases to 99.0°F",
                        "Respiratory rate decreases to 18/min",
                        "Capillary refill time improves from 5 to 2 seconds",
                        "Patient reports decreased thirst"
                    ],
                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "Capillary refill time directly reflects peripheral perfusion status. Improvement from 5 seconds (severely delayed) to 2 seconds (normal) indicates restored tissue perfusion at the microcirculatory level."

                {
                    id: 5,
                    question: "An elderly patient with hypovolemia secondary to poor oral intake is receiving IV fluid replacement. The nurse notes the patient becomes increasingly confused after receiving 1000 mL of 0.45% sodium chloride over 2 hours. What is the MOST likely explanation for this change?",
                    options: [
                        "The hypotonic solution caused cerebral edema",
                        "The patient is experiencing worsening dehydration",
                        "This represents normal aging changes",
                        "The infusion rate was too slow"
                    ],
                    correct: 0,
                    rationale: "Hypotonic solutions (0.45% NaCl) should only be used after the patient is hemodynamically stable because they shift fluid from intravascular to intracellular spaces. Rapid administration in hypovolemic patients can cause cerebral edema as water moves into brain cells, manifesting as confusion or altered mental status."

                    id: 6,
                    question: "A marathon runner presents to the emergency department with severe muscle cramps, dizziness, and dry mucous membranes after completing a race in 95°F weather. Initial treatment with 2 liters of D5W results in worsening confusion and a seizure. What is the MOST likely cause of this deterioration?",
                    options: [
                        "Hyperglycemia from dextrose administration",
                        "Acute hyponatremia from free water administration",
                        "Hypocalcemia from dilution",
                        "Continued hypovolemia requiring more fluids"
                    ],
                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "The runner likely had isotonic fluid losses (sweat contains sodium). Administering D5W (free water after dextrose metabolism) without electrolytes diluted the remaining serum sodium, causing acute hyponatremia. This leads to cerebral edema, confusion, and seizures."
                },
                {
                    id: 7,
                    question: "A patient with chronic kidney disease develops hypovolemia from vomiting. The nurse notes the following: BP 92/58 mmHg, K+ 5.8 mEq/L, creatinine 3.2 mg/dL. Which IV fluid would be MOST appropriate for initial resuscitation?",
                    options: [
                        "Lactated Ringer's solution",
                        "0.9% normal saline",
                        "D5W with 20 mEq KCl",
                        "0.45% sodium chloride"
                    ],
                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) is the safest choice for this patient. With hyperkalemia (K+ 5.8) and kidney disease, fluids containing potassium must be avoided. Lactated Ringer's contains 4 mEq/L of potassium."
                },
                {
                    id: 8,
                    question: "A nurse is monitoring a patient with severe hypovolemia who is receiving rapid IV fluid resuscitation. Which assessment finding would require the nurse to slow the infusion rate?",
                    options: [
                        "Central venous pressure increases from 2 to 8 mmHg",
                        "Jugular veins become visible at 45-degree angle",
                        "Blood pressure increases to 130/85 mmHg",
                        "Heart rate decreases from 115 to 95 bpm"
                    ],
                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Visible jugular veins at 45 degrees indicate elevated venous pressure and potential fluid overload. Normal jugular venous distention should not be visible above the clavicle when the patient is at 45 degrees. This early sign of fluid excess requires slowing the infusion to prevent pulmonary edema."
                },

                    id: 9,

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Oral rehydration solutions contain balanced electrolytes and glucose for optimal absorption, addressing both water and electrolyte components of isotonic fluid loss. Coffee, cola, and beer are diuretics that would worsen hypovolemia."

                    ],
                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Hemoconcentration occurs in fluid volume deficit when blood becomes more concentrated due to water loss. This results in elevated Hgb, Hct, BUN, and urine specific gravity as the kidneys conserve water."

                    id: 11,
                    question: "A patient with heart failure is admitted with bilateral pitting edema, jugular venous distention, and crackles throughout lung fields. Laboratory results show: Na+ 128 mEq/L, Hgb 9.8 g/dL, BUN 15 mg/dL. Which intervention addresses the PRIMARY problem?",

                        "Transfuse packed red blood cells",
                        "Administer furosemide 40 mg IV",
                        "Restrict sodium intake to 2 grams daily"
                    ],
                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "The patient exhibits classic signs of fluid volume excess (FVE) with pulmonary congestion. The lab values show hemodilution (low sodium, hemoglobin, and BUN), confirming FVE rather than true anemia or hyponatremia. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, directly addresses the excess fluid by promoting diuresis."

                    id: 12,
                    question: "A patient receiving treatment for fluid volume excess develops muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias after receiving furosemide 80 mg IV. Which electrolyte imbalance is MOST likely responsible?",
                    options: [
                        "Hypernatremia",
                        "Hypokalemia",

                    ],
                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Loop diuretics like furosemide cause significant potassium loss through increased urinary excretion. Hypokalemia manifests as muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias (flattened T waves, U waves, PVCs). This is a common and dangerous side effect requiring monitoring and replacement."

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "This distribution (400-400-200) best accommodates the patient's needs throughout the day. Most oral medications are given during day/evening shifts, requiring fluid. Patients are typically more active and thirsty during daytime. The smaller night allocation reduces nocturia and sleep disruption while maintaining comfort."

                    id: 14,
                    question: "A patient with cirrhosis develops ascites with the following assessment: abdominal girth 110 cm, weight gain 8 kg over 2 weeks, 3+ pitting edema bilaterally. The patient's serum albumin is 2.1 g/dL. What is the PRIMARY mechanism causing this fluid shift?",
                    options: [
                        "Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure",

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Low albumin (normal 3.5-5.0 g/dL) directly causes decreased plasma oncotic pressure. Albumin maintains the osmotic gradient that keeps fluid in vessels. With cirrhosis, the liver cannot produce adequate albumin, allowing fluid to shift into interstitial spaces (edema) and peritoneal cavity (ascites)."

                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "Combining two potent diuretics (furosemide, a loop diuretic, and metolazone, a thiazide-like diuretic) in a patient with hyponatremia (125 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (3.2 mEq/L) is dangerous. This combination can cause severe electrolyte depletion and dehydration."

                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "The patient is experiencing acute pulmonary edema (pink frothy sputum, severe dyspnea, hypoxia), a life-threatening complication of FVE. After positioning and oxygen, immediate diuresis with IV furosemide is critical to reduce pulmonary congestion."

                    rationale: "The patient is experiencing symptoms of too-rapid fluid removal (disequilibrium syndrome). Decreasing the ultrafiltration rate allows more gradual fluid removal while continuing treatment. This prevents sudden fluid shifts that cause hypotension and cramping."

                    options: [
                        "Continue current treatment without changes",
                        "Increase insulin infusion rate",

                    correct: 2,
                    rationale: "The rapidly falling phosphorus (4.5 → 1.5 mg/dL in 8 hours) during DKA treatment requires IV phosphorus replacement to prevent severe complications. As insulin drives glucose and phosphorus intracellularly and acidosis corrects, total body phosphorus depletion becomes apparent."

                        "They compete for the same binding sites in your blood",

                    correct: 1,
                    rationale: "Calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship maintained by complex homeostatic mechanisms. When phosphorus rises, it binds calcium, lowering free calcium levels. This triggers PTH release, which lowers phosphorus and raises calcium."

                    rationale: "Phosphate binders must be taken with meals to bind dietary phosphorus in the GI tract. Taking on empty stomach defeats the purpose as there's no phosphorus to bind. Sevelamer can bind other medications, so timing is important. Dark stools occur with iron supplements, not sevelamer."

Hyperthyroidism primarily affects calcium metabolism. Hypertension doesn't directly affect phosphorus. Calcium supplements affect calcium-phosphorus balance but don't specifically require phosphorus monitoring."
